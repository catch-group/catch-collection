# Unfixable Conflicts

This document lists conflicts between mods that cannot be resolved with a compatibility patch. These conflicts are unfixable due to the following reasons:

- The mods modify the same records in ways that cannot be merged.
- One of the mods is a full master, but adding it as a master in a patch is not supported by xEdit.
- The records include "Reflection" data, which is not supported by xEdit.
