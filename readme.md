## License

All files in this repository are licensed under the license specified in the **closest license file** within their directory tree. The "closest license file" is determined as follows:

1. If a file's directory (or any of its parent directories) contains a license file (e.g., `license.md`), the terms of the closest license file in the directory tree apply.
2. If no license file is found in the file's directory tree, the file is licensed under the repository-wide default license, [0BSD License](./license.md).
